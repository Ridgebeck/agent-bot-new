  # - text: I don't think that is a city. Did you spell correctly?
  # - text: I don't get it. Is this a city?
  # - text: Can you check your spelling? I don't get it.
  # utter_correct_city:
  # - text: '{city} is correct. Fantastic job! Next, I need to know the intersection where the hackers have planted the transmission device. Just text me the two street names and we will send a team to check it out.'
  # utter_incorrect_city:
  # - text: I don't think {city} is correct.
  # - text: I don't think this city is correct.
  # - text: We already check with the authorities there. That's not the city.
  # - text: I was in contact with the city of {city}. They were not targeted.
  # - text: It's not {city}. We checked.
  # utter_one_street:
  # - text: Ok, that's one of the streets. What's the other?
  # - text: Got it. What's the other street name?
  # - text: Alright, {street} and ...?
  # - text: Ok, so you think {street}, but which cross street?
  # utter_correct_intersection:
  # - text: We sent a team to {intersection}. They found the device - awesome job! Next, you need to look for a 6 digit password to open the door at the hideout. Please hurry up!
  # utter_incorrect_intersection:
  # - text: That doesn't sound correct. I think it must be a different intersection.
  # - text: No, we checked this intersection. That's not it.

  # - text: I already know the name.
  # utter_passcode_old:
  # - text: I already know the passcode.
  # utter_goal_city:
  # - text: You need to figure out which city we need to go to prevent a possible cyber crime.
  # - text: I need to know the name of the city they are targeting. You need to hurry!
  # - text: Can you figure out the city they are targeting for a cyber crime. We need to send our guys there.
  # - text: You need to use the information and figure out which city they are targeting so that we can send somebody there.
  # utter_help_city:
  # - text: I believe the city must be somewhere in the Midwest...if I can trust my sources.
  # - text: I heard them talking about the windy city.
  # - text: I would look for a large city with lots of bridges...shutting them down creates a huge chaos.


  # utter_need_hint:
  # - text: I can check my sources for more detailed information. Do you want me to do that?
  # - text: I thought you are the brains here. Do you want me to go through the data as well?
  # utter_no_hint:
  # - text: Ok, then continue searching. I will wait.
  # - text: Ok, then continue your search.
  # - text: Alright. I will wait.
  # - text: Ok, but please hurry up.
  # - text: Alright, but please hurry.
  # utter_hint_city:
  # - text: Have you checked Illinois? Should be a very large city there.
  # - text: We know it must be one of the largest cities in the US and we are pretty sure that it is not New York or LA.
  # utter_goal_street:
  # - text: We need to find the intersection were the transmission device was installed.
  # - text: We need to find the hacking device. It should be at an intersection.
  # - text: You need to find the intersection with the hacking device. Just tell me the two street names.
  # - text: I need to know the street names of the intersection.
  # utter_help_street:
  # - text: I think it should be a fairly large intersection. You should check the traffic density.
  # - text: The maintenance schedule map should tell you which intersections were officially shut down by the city.
  # - text: Check the maintenance schedule, video recordings and traffic maps.
  # utter_hint_street:
  # - text: I am pretty sure it must be on Oak Street. There is lots of traffic there.
  # - text: Close to the library are a lot of outdated traffic lights. You should check the area around it.
  # utter_goal_password:
  # - text: I need a number code for the lock on the door.
  # - text: You need to find a 6 digit code so that I can open the door.
  # - text: The lock on the door...I need a six digit pass code from you.
  # - text: I need the pass code from you.
  # utter_help_password:
  # - text: You should check the company website from the van picture I sent you.
  # - text: They are using a specific symbol to identify themselves. Maybe you can find it on the website.
  # - text: There must be a secret section on that website somewhere. You have to find it.
  # - text: The front page article on that website talks alot about animals. That might be important.
  # utter_hint_password:
  # - text: I just checked the website myself. The secret section is protected by a password. I think the password is hidden in the front page article.
  # - text: The front page article on that website and the blue triangle are somewhat connected. Maybe a secret access?

  # utter_return_praise:
  # - text: You guys are the best!
  # - text: Awww, thanks!
  # - text: We are the best team...ever!
  # - text: That's what I call team chemistry.
